# controller_launcher
Launch applications with controller using Löve2D. Commands for starting applications address windows only. The rest works on all platforms because of Löve2D.

## Motivation
You sit on the sofa with the controller in your hands and want to play. The computer stands somewhere else, boots and shows steam big picture mode. So far so fine. But what if you want to run other games not part of steam big picture mode?  
This is about presenting a window after system start with a list of games with button (or key) you want to start setting on a sofa with a controller in your hands :)

## Preparations
Configure windows to autologin into a user. This is what you would do if using steam big picture mode too. Instead of starting steam big picture mode we run our Löve2D project.
